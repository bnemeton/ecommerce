# eCommerce Backend

## Description

The backend--models, api routes, etc--for a hypothetical ecommerce platform. Allows for getting, creating, updating, and deleting categories, products, and tags. Uses Sequelize, Express, dotenv, and MySQL 2.

## Usage

It's just the backend, so you can only really interact with it through an API testing application like Insomnia.
